Attempting to make studying cybersecurity completely open source and free to promote strong security hygiene. 

Many sources across the internet teach some things about cybersecurity, but there isn't yet a hollistic free or open source guide where you can find out how to learn all the necessary skills needed to become relevant in today's world of cybersecurity. 

As the cybersecurity landscape is ever evolving we need to keep updated with not only our own knowledge and skills growth, but a higher level of quality for cyber intelligence sharing. Cybersecurity intelligence sharing that is open source, reliable, free, and comprehensive so that anyone from beginners to the most advanced can visit, learn, and become a better cybersecurity professional. 

With that being said, I, Faraz Ismail known on Github as acad3mics will try to build a comprehensive guide starting today 10-10-2020, to help myself first and foremost and the open source community better understand cybersecurity.
