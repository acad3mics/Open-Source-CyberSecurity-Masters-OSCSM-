Attempting to make studying cybersecurity completely open source to promote strong security hygiene. 

Many sources across the internet teach some things about cybersecurity, but there isn't yet a hollistic free or open source guide where you can find out how to learn all the necessary skills needed to become relevant in today's world of cybersecurity. 

As the cybersecurity landscape is ever evolving we need to keep updated with not only our own knowledge and skills growth, but a higher level of quality for cyber intelligence sharing. Cybersecurity intelligence sharing that is open source, reliable, free, and comprehensive so that anyone from beginners to the most advanced can visit, learn, and become a better cybersecurity professional. 

With that being said, I, Faraz Ismail known on Github as acad3mics will try to build a comprehensive guide starting today 10-10-2020, to help myself first and foremost and the open source community better understand cybersecurity. 

A few good places to start. 
1) "Take Back Control Of Your Cybersecurity Now: Game Changing Concepts on AI and Cyber Governance Solutions for Executives" by Paul A. Ferillo and Christoph Veltsos
2) "Threat Modeling: Designing for Security" By Adam Shostack
3) Course titled "Missing Semester" by MIT professor Jon, hosted on youtube. I recommend atleast lectures 1-2 for bash shell scripting, but its better to go through all of the courses. Generally a good security engineer will be able to leverage OS Access Control Lists (ACL's) and kernal programs to enhance system security. Here is Professor Jon's youtube link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z56Jmr9Z34Q&list=PLyzOVJj3bHQuloKGG59rS43e29ro7I57J&index=1
